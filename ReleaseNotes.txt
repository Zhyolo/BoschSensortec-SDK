COINES v2.2

Updates

* Added Python wrapper for coinesAPI - coinespy (compatible with Development Desktop 2.0 genericAPI)
* Added APIs for 16-bit SPI read,write for upcoming sensors
* Included BMI270 examples
* Package manager (python based) for fetching latest sensorAPI included and integrated with COINES Code Editor
* Added software support for Application Board 3.0

COINES v2.1

Updates

* Fixed SPI communication issue with APP2.0 MCU target
* Linux and macOS users can now update APP2.0/BNO USB stick firmware with 'app20-flash' tool
* Fixed APP2.0 flash memory lockout issue (avoid using DD2.0 firmware v3.1-v3.3)
  - Use "update_bootloader" script in firmware/app2.0/coines_bootloader
  - Use 'app20-flash' tool to update to the latest firmware (v3.4)
* Disabled interrupt during I2C transaction to fix periodic data corruption issue
* Fixed trouble with opening USB serial port of Application Board in Ubuntu 18.04 and latest Debian distros.
  - Changed USB CDC ACM protocol from V.25TER mode to None
  - It is not required to stop "ModemManager" service anymore
* Added coines_delay_usec() to use with new sensorAPI like BMI270
* Updated 'examples.mk' so that examples can make use of C++/Assembly code (see 'examples/template' for more information)
* Updated sensorAPI 
  - BMA400 (v1.5.0 --> v1.5.2)
  - BME280 (v3.3.4 --> v3.3.7)
  - BMI08x (v1.2.0 --> v1.4.0)
  - BMI160 (v3.7.5 --> v3.7.7)
  - BMP3xx (v1.1.0 --> v1.1.3)
* BSEC Library updated to 1.4.7.4 (No support for PC targets - Linux and macOS.Run on MCU instead)
* Included support for unofficial boards - Zeus, NÃ¼wa

Known Limitations

* Interrupt streaming is limited to 1kHz for example code [using printf()] running directly on APP2.0 MCU [TARGET=MCU_APP20]

COINES v2.0

Updates

* COINES examples can be cross-compiled to run on APP2.0 microcontroller !!
  - Upgrade to latest DD2.0 firmware v3.1 to run examples on MCU 
   (Use Development Desktop software)
  - Supports RAM and Flash download
* Added 3 new APIs
  - coines_get_millis() - Returns the number of milliseconds passed since the program started (PC and MCU)
  - coines_attach_interrupt() - Attaches a interrupt to a Multi-IO pin ( MCU only )
  - coines_detach_interrupt() - Detaches a interrupt from a Multi-IO pin ( MCU only )
* Usage
  - Install GNU Embedded Toolchain for ARM
  - Go to any example and run
    # mingw32-make TARGET=MCU_APP20 download
  - Open Serial terminal like PuTTY or Hterm . Connect to the serial port and view the output.

Known Limitations

* Support for MCU target is experimental. 
* The below APIs work only with PC Target 
  - coines_config_streaming()
  - coines_start_stop_streaming()
  - coines_read_stream_sensor_data()
  - coines_trigger_timer()
  Hence polling and interrupt streaming examples work with PC target only.
  Make use of coines_attach_interrupt() API for MCU target.
* BHy2 examples are supported only on PC target.
* BSEC examples are not supported for PC target on macOS (Use MCU target)
* Autoreconnect of USB devices is required for MCU code download to work correctly.
  ( USB Device switching during code download - Normal --> USB DFU <---> USB CDC)
  Hence additional settings needs to configured for use with Virtual Machines 
  # Oracle VM VirtualBox - Add devices to USB filter
  # VMWare Workstation   - Not required
